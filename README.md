# A squash scoring app

This is supposed to be used on a mobile device in portrait mode. On desktop or landscape mode on a mobile device the layout will be screwed up. I'll eventually put in a fix for that, but it's low priority as those aren't the expected use-cases for this app.

I've only tested in chrome so far. Mobile firefox and safari may well be broken.
